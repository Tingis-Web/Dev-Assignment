### Project: Task Management Application

## Requirements:

1. Frontend:

   - Create a simple task management application using Vue.js 3 (Composition API).
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Implement features to add, edit, delete, and list tasks.
   - Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

2. Backend:

   - Use NestJS to create a REST API.
   - Implement endpoints to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
   - Use PostgresSql for data persistence and management.

3. Docker:

   - Dockerize both the frontend and backend applications.
   - Provide Dockerfiles and a docker-compose.yml to run the entire application.

4. Documentation:
   - Add a detailed README in the GitHub repository.
   - Include instructions on how to set up and run the application using Docker.
   - Document the API endpoints and their usage.

## Additional Notes:

- Encourage clean, maintainable code with comments where necessary.
- Suggest best practices for commit messages and Git branching strategy.
- Emphasize the importance of writing unit tests for both frontend and backend code.

### Things that will be considered:

- Code quality and adherence to best practices.
- Completeness and correctness of the implemented features.
- Quality of the documentation.
- Effective use of Docker for containerization.

### Assignment: Collaborative Note-Taking Application

## Description:

Welcome to the Collaborative Note-Taking Application assignment. Your task is to create a note-taking application that supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on notes simultaneously. This assignment is designed to assess your advanced skills with the specified tech stack, your ability to implement complex features, and your attention to detail in documentation and testing.

## Requirements:

1. Frontend:

   - Create a collaborative note-taking application using Vue.js 3 (Composition API).
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Implement features for users to create, edit, delete, and share notes.
   - Each note should support rich text formatting (e.g., bold, italics, lists).
   - Implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets.

2. Backend:

   - Use NestJS to create a REST API and WebSocket server.
   - Implement endpoints to handle CRUD operations for notes.
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for data persistence.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT).
   - Ensure that users can only access their own notes unless shared.

3. Docker:

   - Dockerize both the frontend and backend applications.
   - Provide Dockerfiles and a docker-compose.yml to run the entire application.
   - Ensure that the database service is included in the Docker setup.

4. Documentation:
   - Add a detailed README in the GitHub repository.
   - Include instructions on how to set up and run the application using Docker.
   - Document the API endpoints and their usage.
   - Include setup instructions for the database and WebSocket server.

## Additional Notes:

- Encourage clean, maintainable code with comments where necessary.
- Suggest best practices for commit messages and Git branching strategy.
- Emphasize the importance of writing unit tests for both frontend and backend code.

### Things that will be considered:

- Code quality and adherence to best practices.
- Completeness and correctness of the implemented features.
- Quality of the documentation.
- Effective use of Docker for containerization.

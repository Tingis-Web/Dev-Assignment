### Project: Task Management Application

## Requirements:

1. Frontend:

   - Create a collaborative note-taking application using Vue.js 3 (Composition API).
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Implement features for users to create, edit, delete, and share notes.
   - Each note should support rich text formatting (e.g., bold, italics, lists).
   - Implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets.

2. Backend:

   - Use NestJS to create a REST API and WebSocket server.
   - Implement endpoints to handle CRUD operations for notes.
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for data persistence.
   - Implement user authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT).
   - Ensure that users can only access their own notes unless shared.

3. Docker:

   - Dockerize both the frontend and backend applications.
   - Provide Dockerfiles and a docker-compose.yml to run the entire application.
   - Ensure that the database service is included in the Docker setup.

4. Documentation:
   - Add a detailed README in the GitHub repository.
   - Include instructions on how to set up and run the application using Docker.
   - Document the API endpoints and their usage.
   - Include setup instructions for the database and WebSocket server.

## Additional Notes:

- Encourage clean, maintainable code with comments where necessary.
- Suggest best practices for commit messages and Git branching strategy.
- Emphasize the importance of writing unit tests for both frontend and backend code.

### Things that will be considered:

- Code quality and adherence to best practices.
- Completeness and correctness of the implemented features.
- Quality of the documentation.
- Effective use of Docker for containerization.
